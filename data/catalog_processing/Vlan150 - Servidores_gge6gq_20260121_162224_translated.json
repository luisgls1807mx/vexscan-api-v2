For example, authentication may succeed via SSH   but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for   an available SNMP service.\n\n- Providing valid credentials for all available   authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but   the value of successful authentication for a given   protocol may vary from target to target depending upon   what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that   protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH   is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows   targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB   is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux   targets.",

This situation can occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be broken, as stated below :\n\n  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the     server might not be descended from a known public     certificate authority. This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.\n\n  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.\n\n  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.\n\nIf the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

      "description": "The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.\nMitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.\n\nAs long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.\n\nThe TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.\n\nThis is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.",

      "description": "The version of Apache httpd installed on the remote host is prior to 2.4.64. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the 2.4.64 advisory.\n\n  - In certain proxy configurations, a denial of service attack against Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.26     through to 2.4.63 can be triggered by untrusted clients causing an assertion in mod_proxy_http2.\n    Configurations affected are a reverse proxy is configured for an HTTP/2 backend, with ProxyPreserveHost     set to on. (CVE-2025-49630)\n\n  - HTTP response splitting in the core of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker who can manipulate the     Content-Type response headers of applications hosted or proxied by the server can split the HTTP response.\n    This vulnerability was described as CVE-2023-38709 but the patch included in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 did     not address the issue. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64, which fixes this issue.\n    (CVE-2024-42516)\n\n  - SSRF in Apache HTTP Server with mod_proxy loaded allows an attacker to send outbound proxy requests to a     URL controlled by the attacker. Requires an unlikely configuration where mod_headers is configured to     modify the Content-Type request or response header with a value provided in the HTTP request. Users are     recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64 which fixes this issue. (CVE-2024-43204)\n\n  - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Apache HTTP Server on Windows allows to potentially leak NTLM hashes     to a malicious server via mod_rewrite or apache expressions that pass unvalidated request input. This     issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.0 through 2.4.63. Note: The Apache HTTP Server Project will be     setting a higher bar for accepting vulnerability reports regarding SSRF via UNC paths. The server offers     limited protection against administrators directing the server to open UNC paths. Windows servers should     limit the hosts they will connect over via SMB based on the nature of NTLM authentication.\n    (CVE-2024-43394)\n\n  - Insufficient escaping of user-supplied data in mod_ssl in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.63 and earlier allows an     untrusted SSL/TLS client to insert escape characters into log files in some configurations. In a logging     configuration where CustomLog is used with %{varname}x or %{varname}c to log variables provided by     mod_ssl such as SSL_TLS_SNI, no escaping is performed by either mod_log_config or mod_ssl and unsanitized     data provided by the client may appear in log files. (CVE-2024-47252)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.",

The fix for bug 60013 introduced a regression     where the rewritten URL was normalized before it was decoded. This introduced the possibility that, for     rewrite rules that rewrite query parameters to the URL, an attacker could manipulate the request URI to     bypass security constraints including the protection for /WEB-INF/ and /META-INF/. If PUT requests were     also enabled then malicious files could be uploaded leading to remote code execution. PUT requests are     normally limited to trusted users and it is considered unlikely that PUT requests would be enabled in     conjunction with a rewrite that manipulated the URI. This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1     through 11.0.10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44, from 9.0.0.M11 through 9.0.108.

(CVE-2025-55752)\n\n  - Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. Tomcat did     not escape ANSI escape sequences in log messages. If Tomcat was running in a console on a Windows     operating system, and the console supported ANSI escape sequences, it was possible for an attacker to use     a specially crafted URL to inject ANSI escape sequences to manipulate the console and the clipboard and     attempt to trick an administrator into running an attacker controlled command. While no attack vector was     found, it may have been possible to mount this attack on other operating systems. This issue affects     Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44, from 9.0.40 through     9.0.108.

      "description": "The version of Tomcat installed on the remote host is prior to 9.1.109. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the fixed_in_apache_tomcat_9.1.109_security-9 advisory.\n\n  - Relative Path Traversal vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. The fix for bug 60013 introduced a regression     where the rewritten URL was normalized before it was decoded. This introduced the possibility that, for     rewrite rules that rewrite query parameters to the URL, an attacker could manipulate the request URI to     bypass security constraints including the protection for /WEB-INF/ and /META-INF/. If PUT requests were     also enabled then malicious files could be uploaded leading to remote code execution. PUT requests are     normally limited to trusted users and it is considered unlikely that PUT requests would be enabled in     conjunction with a rewrite that manipulated the URI. This issue affects Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1     through 11.0.10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44, from 9.0.0.M11 through 9.0.108. The following versions     were EOL at the time the CVE was created but are known to be affected: 8.5.6 though 8.5.100. Other, older,     EOL versions may also be affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 11.0.11 or later, 10.1.45     or later or 9.0.109 or later, which fix the issue. (CVE-2025-55752)\n\n  - Improper Neutralization of Escape, Meta, or Control Sequences vulnerability in Apache Tomcat. Tomcat did     not escape ANSI escape sequences in log messages. If Tomcat was running in a console on a Windows     operating system, and the console supported ANSI escape sequences, it was possible for an attacker to use     a specially crafted URL to inject ANSI escape sequences to manipulate the console and the clipboard and     attempt to trick an administrator into running an attacker controlled command. While no attack vector was     found, it may have been possible to mount this attack on other operating systems. This issue affects     Apache Tomcat: from 11.0.0-M1 through 11.0.10, from 10.1.0-M1 through 10.1.44, from 9.0.40 through     9.0.108.

      "description": "The version of OpenSSH installed on the remote host is prior to 9.6. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the release-9.6 advisory.\n\n  - ssh(1), sshd(8): implement protocol extensions to thwart the so-called Terrapin attack discovered by     Fabian Bumer, Marcus Brinkmann and Jrg Schwenk. This attack allows a MITM to effect a limited break of     the integrity of the early encrypted SSH transport protocol by sending extra messages prior to the     commencement of encryption, and deleting an equal number of consecutive messages immediately after     encryption starts. A peer SSH client/server would not be able to detect that messages were deleted. While     cryptographically novel, the security impact of this attack is fortunately very limited as it only allows     deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this stage of the protocol prevents user     user authentication from proceeding and results in a stuck connection. The most serious identified impact     is that it lets a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication starts, allowing     the attacker to disable a subset of the keystroke timing obfuscation features introduced in OpenSSH 9.5.\n    There is no other discernable impact to session secrecy or session integrity. OpenSSH 9.6 addresses this     protocol weakness through a new strict KEX protocol extension that will be automatically enabled when     both the client and server support it. This extension makes two changes to the SSH transport protocol to     improve the integrity of the initial key exchange. Firstly, it requires endpoints to terminate the     connection if any unnecessary or unexpected message is received during key exchange (including messages     that were previously legal but not strictly required like SSH2_MSG_DEBUG). This removes most malleability     from the early protocol. Secondly, it resets the Message Authentication Code counter at the conclusion of     each key exchange, preventing previously inserted messages from being able to make persistent changes to     the sequence number across completion of a key exchange. Either of these changes should be sufficient to     thwart the Terrapin Attack. More details of these changes are in the PROTOCOL file in the OpenSSH source     distribition. (CVE-2023-48795)\n\n  - ssh-agent(1): when adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys while specifying destination constraints, if the     PKCS#11 token returned multiple keys then only the first key had the constraints applied. Use of regular     private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected. (CVE-2023-51384)\n\n  - ssh(1): if an invalid user or hostname that contained shell metacharacters was passed to ssh(1), and a     ProxyCommand, LocalCommand directive or match exec predicate referenced the user or hostname via %u, %h     or similar expansion token, then an attacker who could supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh(1) could     potentially perform command injection depending on what quoting was present in the user-supplied     ssh_config(5) directive. This situation could arise in the case of git submodules, where a repository     could contain a submodule with shell characters in its user/hostname. Git does not ban shell     metacharacters in user or host names when checking out repositories from untrusted sources. Although we     believe it is the user's responsibility to ensure validity of arguments passed to ssh(1), especially     across a security boundary such as the git example above, OpenSSH 9.6 now bans most shell metacharacters     from user and hostnames supplied via the command-line. This countermeasure is not guaranteed to be     effective in all situations, as it is infeasible for ssh(1) to universally filter shell metacharacters     potentially relevant to user-supplied commands. User/hostnames provided via ssh_config(5) are not subject     to these restrictions, allowing configurations that use strange names to continue to be used, under the     assumption that the user knows what they are doing in their own configuration files.

      "description": "The version of OpenSSL installed on the remote host is prior to 1.1.1t. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the 1.1.1t advisory.\n\n  - There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName.\n    X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME     incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently     interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL     checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may     allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or     enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate     chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these     inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is     uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented     their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network. (CVE-2023-0286)\n\n  - The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is     primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may     also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a     new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the     BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid,     the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this     case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal     pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then     a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the     internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call     BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions     PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1,     SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include     i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL     cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected. (CVE-2023-0215)\n\n  - The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the name (e.g.\n    CERTIFICATE), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the name_out,     header and data arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data.\n    The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results     in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate     the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this     buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an     attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service     attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and     therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a     number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file()     which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the     caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations     include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL     asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue. (CVE-2022-4450)\n\n  - A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient     to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful     decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption.\n    The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS     connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An     attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send     trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number     of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be     able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection. (CVE-2022-4304)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.",

      "description": "The version of OpenSSL installed on the remote host is prior to 1.1.1u. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the 1.1.1u advisory.\n\n  - Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or data containing them may be     very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of the OpenSSL     subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to     very long delays when processing those messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service. An OBJECT     IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers - most of which have no size limit.\n    OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the     OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT     IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by periods. When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER     is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of KiBs), the     translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time. The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n'     being the size of the sub-identifiers in bytes (*). With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic     algorithms using names / identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs     in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms. Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be     received through the ASN.1 structure AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to     specify what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or decrypt, or digest     passed data. Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are affected, with any     version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the mere purpose of display, the severity is considered low. In     OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts     anything that processes X.509 certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature. The     impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100KiB limit on the peer's     certificate chain. Additionally, this only impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client     authentication. In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects, such as X.509     certificates. This is assumed to not happen in such a way that it would cause a Denial of Service, so     these versions are considered not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,     and the severity is therefore considered low. (CVE-2023-2650)\n\n  - Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be vulnerable to an attack from     a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks. Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are     silently ignored by OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate. A     malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies in order to circumvent     policy checking on the certificate altogether. Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled     by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the     `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function. (CVE-2023-0465)\n\n  - The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to implicitly enable the certificate policy     check when doing certificate verification. However the implementation of the function does not enable the     check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect policies to pass the certificate verification.\n    As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to keep the existing     behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() function. Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to     perform certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() or explicitly enable the     policy check by calling X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag argument.\n    Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications.\n    (CVE-2023-0466)\n\n  - A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions of OpenSSL related to the     verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit     this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers exponential use of     computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on affected systems. Policy     processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy' argument to the command line     utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

      "description": "The version of OpenSSL installed on the remote host is prior to 1.1.1w. It is, therefore, affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the 1.1.1w advisory.\n\n  - Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains a bug that might     corrupt the internal state of applications on the Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86_64     processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions. Impact summary: If in an application that uses the     OpenSSL library an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application     state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences. The POLY1305 MAC (message     authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does not save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on     Windows 64 platform when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to the caller     all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their previous content. The vulnerable code is     used only on newer x86_64 processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions. The consequences of this     kind of internal application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling     application does not depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst     consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application process. However given the     contents of the registers are just zeroized so the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most     likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a     crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the     CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of     this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether     this AEAD cipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using OpenSSL can be     potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be     affected by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.

After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter     value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if     present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if     q is larger than p.

A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and     may come from an untrusted source.

It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the 1.1.1y advisory.\n\n  - Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded memory growth when     processing TLSv1.3 sessions Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to     trigger unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service This problem can occur in TLSv1.3     if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is being used (but not if early_data support is also configured     and the default anti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the session     cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly as it fills. The session cache     will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A malicious client could deliberately create the scenario     for this failure to force a Denial of Service.

However, only     applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are affected by this issue. Applications     that do not call this function are not vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is     rarely used by applications. The SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer     used when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected to succeed if the     buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have been identified where the buffer is freed even     when still in use. The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the network and     processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived. In this case calling SSL_free_buffers     will succeed even though a record has only been partially processed and the buffer is still in use. The     second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has been received and processed by     OpenSSL but the application has only read part of this data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed     even though the buffer is still in use. While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal     operation a malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.

      "description": "The version of OpenSSL installed on the remote host is prior to 1.1.1za. It is, therefore, affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the 1.1.1za advisory.\n\n  - Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an empty supported client     protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer. Impact summary: A buffer     overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash.\n    In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent     to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the     SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this     issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may     occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application. The     OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN     (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never     standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely     deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a     list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also     appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in     the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the     case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this     condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was     no overlap in the lists). This function is typically called from a server side application callback for     ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by     the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the     application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the     SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in     the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the     application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed     that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly     handle a no overlap response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will     be vulnerable to this problem. In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically     select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap     case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally     be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called     with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses     this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur. This issue has been     assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN     instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming     error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation     unlikely. The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. Due to the low     severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time.

Impact summary: Out of bound memory     writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all     the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only named curves are     supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary     (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a     vulnerable application is low. In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509     certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates.

      "description": "The version of Tomcat installed on the remote host is prior to 9.0.31. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the fixed_in_apache_tomcat_9.0.31_security-9 advisory.\n\n  - When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to     Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP     connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be     surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped     with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected     (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This     vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the     web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application     allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control     the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a     file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only     required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth     approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to     Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP     Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading     to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.\n    (CVE-2020-1938)\n\n  - In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99 the HTTP header parsing code used     an approach to end-of-line parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This led     to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly     handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered     unlikely. (CVE-2020-1935)\n\n  - The refactoring present in Apache Tomcat 9.0.28 to 9.0.30, 8.5.48 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.98 to 7.0.99     introduced a regression. The result of the regression was that invalid Transfer-Encoding headers were     incorrectly processed leading to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a     reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a     reverse proxy is considered unlikely. (CVE-2019-17569)\n\nNote that Nessus has not tested for these issues but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.",
